# üåå Quenching in the Green Valley: SDSS vs. IllustrisTNG & EAGLE

A fully reproducible, open-science benchmark for AGN host galaxy quenching in simulations and observations.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

Can modern simulations actually match the real universe when it comes to AGN host galaxies in the "green valley"?  
This repo hosts all code, processed data, and figures for:

> **Quenching in the Green Valley at Low Redshift: A Comparative Analysis of AGN Host Galaxies in SDSS, IllustrisTNG and EAGLE**  
> *Gaurav Gawade (MNRAS, 2025)*

We pit 21,649 real AGN hosts from SDSS DR7 against simulated analogues in IllustrisTNG-100 and EAGLE.  
Spoiler: **the simulations don‚Äôt agree with the universe, and it‚Äôs not even close.** For full results, see the manuscript!

---

## üèÜ Highlights

- **Huge sSFR mismatch:** TNG ‚Äúgreen-valley‚Äù galaxies are over-quenched by up to 5.3 dex; EAGLE galaxies are under-quenched by ~1.1 dex.
- **Simulation overproduction:** TNG overpopulates the green valley by nearly an order of magnitude.
- **Zero hand-waving:** All sample selection, statistics, and figures are fully reproducible.
- **All code, all data, all open.** If you want to test, tweak, or extend‚Äîthis is your launchpad.

## üíª How to Run/Reproduce

1. **Clone and set up environment:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TshapedAsh/Green-Valley-AGN-SDSS-TNG.git
    cd Green-Valley-AGN-SDSS-TNG
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate green-valley-env
    ```
    *Or* use pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Download data:**
    - [SDSS DR7](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/Data/)
    - [IllustrisTNG100-1](https://www.tng-project.org/data/downloads/TNG100-1/)
    - [EAGLE Ref-L0100N1504](http://virgodb.dur.ac.uk:8080/Eagle/)
    - Place files in the `data/` directory. See the notebook for exact file names.

3. **Run the notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook master_notebook.ipynb
    ```
    - Figures will be generated in `outputs/figures/`.
